The repository for IAP program of SimGETRO designed based on the ch32v203 chip.

## Compiling

Currently, you need to install Risc-GCC (WCH) in order to compile the firmware correctly.
Also, you might need VS Code & Embedded IDE plugin as your IDE progrom.
Use WCHISPtool to burn firmware to your device.

要编译源代码，请在您的 VSCode 中安装 EIDE 作为开发编译环境，并使用 EIDE 安装 RISCV_GCC 和 OPENOCD_WCH 8.2.0 ，如果您使用其他版本的 openocd ，请修改 EIDE项目 中的 构建配置->右键菜单 修改您的工具链路径。请注意，更改工具链版本可能会造成无法编译。

要烧入固件，请使用 WCHISPTools，并使用 USB 方式烧入。
